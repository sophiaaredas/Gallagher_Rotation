# Gallagher_Rotation

Hello! For this rotation in the Gallagher lab I will be working with cdgC (found on chromosome) and cdgG (plasmid borne) and will be doing a BACTH experiment to see any interactions.

Additionally my side project will be attempting to create a pipeline to use AlphaPullDown to bioinformatically predict any protein interactions with a given protein of interest.

For now I wil organize this repo into two main folders but this is subject to change:
1. BACTH
- This will include my electronic lab notebook written in RMarkdown which will include my protocols, notes, data, and potentially results?
    - This will be called BACTH_Notebook
- This will include my primers that are on a google sheet

2. AlphaPullDown
- So far I will push the database of the sven proteins (there are ~17k proteins) that will be used to compare whatever the protein of interest is and compare it to the 17k database
- This will also include my RMarkdown file which is a notebook that will include my protocols (of how to hopefully run AlphaPullDown), notes, and potentially results.
    - This will be called AlphaPullDown_Notebook
 
Note that this is an ever changing document and I hope to keep it updated enough and that it makes sense for any future readers. If it doesnt please let me know:)
